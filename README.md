Example Node JS source code for a Directory Listing server using Express, HTTPS, Auth Digest and more.<br >
You can serve it locally to work with corresponding iOS and Android app.
<pre>
Instructions:
Install Node JS from https://nodejs.org/en/ (latest LTS version 6).
For example, I used v6.10.0 LTS at the time.

Clone this repo and within the directory type:
npm install

Adjust your ip within config.js (ie. hostname setting)

To start NodeJS server type:
npm start

Make sure to configure the same IP within the iOS or Android app (README available for each).
</pre>
